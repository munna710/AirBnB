# AirBnB
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for visualizing Airbnb data in different cities. The dashboard provides insights into the Airbnb market, including price trends, availability, and popularity.

Data Sources
The dashboard uses Airbnb data obtained from the Inside Airbnb website. The data includes listings, calendar availability, and reviews for several cities around the world.

Usage
Download and install Tableau Desktop on your computer.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb.git
Open Tableau Desktop and select "Open" from the "File" menu. Navigate to the repository directory and select the airbnb_data_visualisation.twb file to open the Tableau workbook.

In the Tableau workbook, navigate to the "Data Source" tab and update the data connection to use the Airbnb data files for the desired city. You can do this by clicking on the "Edit Data Source" button and following the prompts.

Once the data connection has been updated, navigate back to the "Dashboard" tab to view the Airbnb Data Visualisation dashboard. The dashboard consists of several interactive visualizations that allow you to explore Airbnb data for the selected city.
